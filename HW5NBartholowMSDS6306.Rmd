```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
```


## Question 1 - Data Munging 
###a. import the .txt file
```{r read 2016 file into dataframe df and assign meaningful column names}
df <- read.delim("/Users/nicolealphin/Desktop/DataScience/MSDS6306-DoingDataScience/HW/LiveSessionAssignment5/yob2016.txt", header=FALSE, sep=";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, col.names = c("Name", "Gender", "NumberChildrenGivenName"))
df$Gender <- as.factor(df$Gender)
```

###b. Display Summary
```{r display summary and structure of df}
summary(df)
str(df)
```

###c. Find duplicate name
Remove blank observations, rows and
Create 2 columns, Actor & Character
```{r  get row for duplicate name }
yyy <- grep("yyy", df$Name)
df[yyy,]
```

###d. Remove Duplicate Name and Save Dataset Object
```{r remove duplicate name and save df as new object y2016}
y2016<-slice(df, -yyy)
```

## Question 2 - Data Merging
###a. import the .txt file
```{r read 2015 file into dataframe df}
y2015 <- read.csv("/Users/nicolealphin/Desktop/DataScience/MSDS6306-DoingDataScience/HW/LiveSessionAssignment5/yob2015.txt", header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE, col.names = c("Name", "Gender", "NumberChildrenGivenName"))
df$Gender <- as.factor(df$Gender)
```

###b. Read the last 10 rows of y2015 and comment on anything interesting about the data
####The last 10 rows of the 2015 dataset are all Male names and each name was bestowed on five children
####based on the summary stats, a name must have been given to at least 5 children in a year to make the list 
```{r read tail of df }
tail(y2015, 10)
```

###c. Merge 2015 and 2016 by Name
```{r merge dataframes by Name columns}
#HW says to merge by Name column
final <- merge(y2016, y2015, by="Name")
#I prefer to merge by Name AND Gender for the next exercise
final <- merge(y2016, y2015, by.x=c("Name","Gender"), by.y =c("Name","Gender"))
```

## Question 3 - Data Summary 
###a. Create Total column for the total number of children of each name in both years combined
```{r create Total column}
final$Total <- final$NumberChildrenGivenName.x + final$NumberChildrenGivenName.y
```

###b. Display 10 Most Popular
```{r display most popular names for both genders}
final <- final[order(final$Total, decreasing = TRUE),]
TopTen <- head(final, 10)
TopTen
```

###c. Display 10 Most Popular Girls Names
```{r create new table of girls names and clean }
#This total is the total number of Females named these names over a two year period.  There are also boys assigned these names, but that does not change the popularity
GirlsFinal <- final[final$Gender == "F",]
GirlsFinal <- data.frame(GirlsFinal$Name, GirlsFinal$Total)
TopTen <- head(GirlsFinal, 10)
TopTen
```

###d. Save Girls Names and Totals to TopTenGirls csv file
```{r write top ten girls names to csv}
write.csv(TopTen, "TopTenGirls.csv")
```

## Question 4 - Upload to Github 
###a. Push at minimum your RMarkdown for this homework assignment and a Codebook to one of your GitHub repositories (you might place this in a Homework repo like last week).  The Codebook should contain a short definition of each object you create, and if creating multiple files, which file it is contained in.  You are welcome and encouraged to add other filesâ€”just make sure you have a description and directions that are helpful for the grader.
### I looked up several codebooks, and wasn't sure if I should also describe the input files, the intermediate objects, etc. I appreciate any and all feedback!
